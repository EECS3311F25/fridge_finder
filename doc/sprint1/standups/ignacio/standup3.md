### [October 27, 2025] – Sprint 1 Standup #1

**Worked on:**  
I am working cooperatively with the people in charge of the View classes to make this project ready to debug, I finished all controller classes for sprint 1 given that I had to change some fields given requests from my partners that are making the View Classes. I also worked on the software architecture diagram because I had to see the final structure of the project. to finalize this part.

**Next:**  
I will try to finish the software architecture diagram by today and hopefully we can fulfil all PBs we have to complete for Spring 1

**Blockers:**  
Altough much work has been done, we are very tight on the due date and hope to get it in time.
