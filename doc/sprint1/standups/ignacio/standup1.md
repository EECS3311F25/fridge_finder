🗓️ [October 27, 2025] – Sprint 1 Standup #1
## Worked on:
Implemented item.dart and fridge.dart for the backend, establishing relationships between users, fridges, and items. Created classes Item and Fridge with said constructors. 
## Next -> 
Refine backend logic and collaborate with the team on the architecture diagram to ensure smooth integration between models and the frontend. Start integrating functionalities from the front-end to the back-end.
## Blockers:
None currently — just monitoring backend and database schema alignment.
