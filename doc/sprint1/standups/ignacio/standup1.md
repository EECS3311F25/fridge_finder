### 🗓️ [October 27, 2025] – Sprint 1 Standup #1

**Worked on:**
Implemented item.dart and fridge.dart for the backend, defining the Item and Fridge classes with constructors and data mappings. Established relationships between users, fridges, and items to support database integration and future frontend interaction.

**Next:**
Refine backend logic and collaborate with the team on the architecture diagram to ensure seamless integration between models and the frontend. Begin connecting backend features with the UI, focusing on enabling core functionalities such as food logging and retrieval.

**Blockers:**
Understanding the **View** layer structure will be key to properly integrating backend features and supporting interactive functionalities like item tracking and logging within the app.
