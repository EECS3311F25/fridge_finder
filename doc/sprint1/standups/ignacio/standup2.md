### [October 27, 2025] – Sprint 1 Standup #1

**Worked on:**  
Implemented all the controller classes needed for Sprint 1 — `create_item_controller.dart`, `home_controller.dart`, and `login_controller.dart`.  
Created a class for each file with the methods specified in the `systemdesign.md` file and based on each CRC card.  
Also participated in the RPM meeting and discussed how we are going to reach our goals for Sprint 1.  

**Next:**  
I will be debugging all my methods and classes once the model and view layers are completed and running.  
I’ll be working collaboratively with both the backend and frontend teams to achieve full functionality.  

**Blockers:**  
Having a solid view UI with its classes will be essential for the near future and the completion of Sprint 1.  
Although it is not a blocker to finish my work, it would still be very helpful to have that implemented soon.
