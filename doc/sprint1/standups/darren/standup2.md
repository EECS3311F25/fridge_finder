[29/10/2025] - Sprint #1 Standup #1
**1. What did you work on since the last standup?**
I created the views folder for front end development. This is where screen is going to be located. I simplified main.dart to not have any front end implementation. Then I implemented the basics of home_view.dart, showing a header, search bar, and scrollable item grid. And I also created add_item.dart and food_item.dart

**2. What do you commit to next?**
I will make it so when you click on the boxes, it brings you to a food_item_view.dart and I will implement the add button to home screen, which should bring you to add_item_view.dart

**3. When do you think you'll be done?**
I will work on it more tomorrow

**4. Do you have any blockers?**
There are no blockers
