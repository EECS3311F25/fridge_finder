[02/11/2025] - Sprint #1 Standup #1
**1. What did you work on since the last standup?**
I created food_item_view.dart and fully added all of its UI elements, such as food name, image placehoder, quantity, with increase/decrease function, and add/expires dates

**2. What do you commit to next?**
I will make sure the view has item objects which the user can add/delete/inspect instead of hard coded items

**3. When do you think you'll be done?**
My goal is to finish it Monday Nov 3

**4. Do you have any blockers?**
Yes, I need to wait for my groupmates to me done their part, so I can begin mine without interference
