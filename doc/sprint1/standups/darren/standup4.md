[03/11/2025] - Sprint #1 Standup #4
**1. What did you work on since the last standup?**
I finished making the front end use a list of items, instead of just lists of their attributes, so users are able to create item objects using the backend. I also improved all of the view classes: home, add item, and food item, so that their designs use the same text styles/layouts/buttons to make the app seem visually better.

**2. What do you commit to next?**
I will make the account view

**3. When do you think you'll be done?**
IMy goal is to make the account view the next few days

**4. Do you have any blockers?**
Yes, some group members are going to work on improving the existing code before we expand it and add new screens
