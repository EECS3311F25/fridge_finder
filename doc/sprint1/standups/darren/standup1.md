[27/10/2025] - Sprint #1 Standup #1
**1. What did you work on since the last standup?**
I created the Trello list for product backlog. PB 1,2,3,6 are all in progress.
I am learning how to use Flutter for front end development and UI, so I made some small changes to main.dart for learning.
I added background color, text, styled the text, aligned the container, and other small additions

**2. What do you commit to next?**
I will set up a new class for the front end of the home menu so it is seperate from main.dart. I plan to create widgets for: title of "Fridge Finder", a search bar, a grid of items, and a plus button, and I will set up their allingmnets, so then after I can work on their functionality.

**3. When do you think you'll be done?**
I am going to continue working on this after the exam on Wednesday, so hopefully I get some meaningful progress done after the exam.

**4. Do you have any blockers?**
Yes, there needs to be a class outside of main.dart to implement the home screen, and I am waiting for a homeView method in the backend that I was told to wait for, so I can start working on the home screen. I also need to learn more about flutter to be able to actualize what I want to get done.
