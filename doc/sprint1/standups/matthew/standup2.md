[11/2/2025] - Sprint #1 Standup #2
**1. What did you work on since the last standup?**
I implemented the add_item_view.dart file. I also connected the main menu with this page. 

**2. What do you commit to next?**
I want to connect each item to the "item_view" page, so that the information that its added its view in the main menu and then when clicked, showed in the view_item page. also a delete button in the view_item page

**3. When do you think you'll be done?**
I can do it before sprint 1 is due on Monday

**4. Do you have any blockers?**
I dont have any blockers for the implementation part, the only thing that I might be worried about is how it will be connected to the backend since as right now, it is just displayig unsaved information
