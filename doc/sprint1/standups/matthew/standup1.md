[29/10/2025] - Sprint #1 Standup #1
**1. What did you work on since the last standup?**
I divded the PB's into subtasks, added them to Trello and assign them to the team. 


**2. What do you commit to next?**
I will start to connect the front end componenets of the home page with the backend services so the app can start having functionallities

**3. When do you think you'll be done?**
Since my midterms were dont today, I can fully focus on the app now, I guess I can have a good progress before the sprint1 due date.

**4. Do you have any blockers?**
My main blockers were that I had to study for my midterms. But now I can fully work on it. Besides that the only 'blockers' that I could have are that connecting the UI with the backend functionallities depends on the how much of these 2 parts are done. But since there is a good progress already, I can work on it pretty smoothly.
