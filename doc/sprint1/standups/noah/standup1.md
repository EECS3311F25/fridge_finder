27/10/2025 - Sprint 1 Standup 1

1. **What did you work on since the last standup?:** I created the CRC cards, made the User and UserDatabaseHelper classes, and touched up the Fridge and Item classes.
2. **What do you commit to next?:** My next step is to make the abstract DatabaseHelper class, go back and amend the UserDatabaseHelper class to account for that, then make the FridgeDatabaseHelper and ItemDatabaseHelper classes.
3. **When do you think you'll be done?:** I reckon I can get this done tomorrow.
4. **Do you have any blockers?:** Yes, representing the specific foreign key and one-to-one relationships between these classes in the database will be challenging, especially given that I have little experience working with database systems.
