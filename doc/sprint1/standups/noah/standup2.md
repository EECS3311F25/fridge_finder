29/10/2025 - Sprint 1 Standup 2

1. **What did you work on since the last standup?:** I created the DatabaseHelper superclass, and created the subclasses that implement it. I also implemented it in the UserDatabaseHelper class, which already existed but wasn't specified in a way that extended DatabaseHelper. I also logged the RPM meeting.
2. **What do you commit to next?:** Next I will try to find a way to set up the database itself, likely locally. I apologize if this is a malformed statement, I'm very new to database systems.
3. **When do you think you'll be done?:** Hopefully by the weekend.
4. **Do you have any blockers?:** My knowledge of database systems will make this tricky and tedious, but hopefully I can be a quick learner.
