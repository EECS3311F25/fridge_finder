### Unfinished Tasks
- Filtering
- PB 2 in its entirety
- Expiration status

### Future practices
- Mantaining MVC architecture (Followed software architecture diagram)
- Good separation of concerns 

### New Practices
- When encountering trouble, don't try to redesign it in your own

### Harmful practices we don't want to use for Sprint 2
- Procastinating tasks closer to due dates
- Don't take the world on your own (Each one has its part).


### Best & Worst experiences in Sprint 1
- Best:

    Noah:
    Matthew: My best practice in Sprint 1 was to understand the importance of the creation and follow of the CSC cards and the user experience docuemntation done in speint0. At the start sprint1, I wasint following the documentation, which made it really confusing on how it will be implementted with my classmates. It was like I was doing thr project by myslef, that, even though I was "making a lot of progress" it wasint useful since my classmates didnt know how to use what I coded. It wasint until I started following the architecure that I was actually making progress, the project took form in my head, and actually made it easier to implement the pages, especially the connection and the communication between them.

- Worst:

    Noah:
    Matthew: The worst experience was actually try to implement stuff without reading and understanding what was done by my classmates first. When I started coding, at first I started to build upon some ideas that I had of how the code should look. As I said, it was like I was doing the project by myself, but that made it really hard for the entire app to actually work. Whatever I would implement wouldnt work, and actually will break other parts of the code, becuase the connection wasint made, so other parts that would expect stuff, woudnt get it and will get me errors on whatever I would do. Reading the code of my classmantews before implementing and unserstanding first the entire structure was the most important step in this first sprint.
