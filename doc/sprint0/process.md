# Process Document (Sprint 0)

## Organization

Throughout sprint 0 our primary tool and method of communication was Discord. Beyond that, we created a product backlog on Trello. The project was setup on VS Code, as it is the recommended editor for creating cross-platform Flutter applications. Since sprint 0 was primarily pre-emptive organization, rather than technical implementation, not many other tools were needed.

## Team Strategy

We agreed to meet at least twice per week, and used consensus-based decision-making when any kind of discernment was needed. Tasks were delegated also by consensus, wherein team members claimed tasks, then a gentle redistribution was conducted to ensure everyone had equal work. Throughout sprint 0 there were no conflicts or disputes.

## Lessons Learned

- We must meet more frequently in order to clear up any confusion that may arise on any given day. Simple 10-minute standups would suffice.
- When more technical sprints roll around we will likely have to assign roles (ie. backend developer, UI developer, etc.). We also need a more concrete framework within which we divvy up the tasks for a given sprint.
