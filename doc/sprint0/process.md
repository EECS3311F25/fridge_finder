# Process Document (Sprint 0)

## Organization

Throughout sprint 0 our primary tool and method of communication was Discord. Beyond that, we created a product backlog on Trello. The project was setup on VS Code, as it is the recommended editor for creating cross-platform Flutter applications. Since sprint 0 was primarily pre-emptive organization, rather than technical implementation, not many other tools were needed.

## Technical Implementation

During this sprint, the only technical implementation conducted was the project setup. It was done on VS Code using Flutter 3.35.5, which is the latest stable release. Android Studio was a necessary tool to download and install relevant dependencies, which include:
- Android 16.0 (API level 36.0)
- Android SDK Build-Tools
- Android SDK Command-line Tools (latest)
- Andorid SDK PLatform-Tools (36.0.0)
- Android Emulator (36.1.9)

After the installation of the Android SDK, it was necessary to point Flutter to the location of the SDK. Then, an empty Flutter project was created.

## Team Strategy

We agreed to meet at least twice per week, and used consensus-based decision-making when any kind of discernment was needed. Tasks were delegated also by consensus, wherein team members claimed tasks, then a gentle redistribution was conducted to ensure everyone had equal work. Throughout sprint 0 there were no conflicts or disputes.

## Lessons Learned

- We must meet more frequently in order to clear up any confusion that may arise on any given day. Simple 10-minute standups would suffice.
- When more technical sprints roll around we will likely have to assign roles (ie. backend developer, UI developer, etc.). We also need a more concrete framework within which we divvy up the tasks for a given sprint.
