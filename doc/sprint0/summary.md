## Project Summary: Fridge Finder

### Project Objectives
Fridge Finder is a mobile app that helps users manage the food they already have at home. Its main objective is to reduce food waste and save money by keeping users aware of what’s in their fridge and when items are about to expire. The app allows users to log groceries with expiry dates, receive reminders before food spoils, and get recipe suggestions based on what they currently own. By simplifying how people track and use their food, Fridge Finder helps turn everyday routines into smarter, more sustainable habits.

### Key Users
Fridge Finder is designed for a range of users who struggle to keep track of food at home:
- **Families** managing larger inventories and looking to reduce wasted groceries.  
- **Working professionals** who want to plan quick meals and save money.  
- **Students** who live busy academic lives and often forget what’s in their fridge.  

These users share the same pain point: they lack an easy, time-efficient way to manage groceries without adding more stress to their routines.

### Key Scenarios
1. **At work:** A busy parent checks the app to see what ingredients are close to expiring and plans dinner before heading home.  
2. **At the grocery store:** A student uses Fridge Finder to avoid buying duplicate items by checking what’s already in their fridge.  
3. **At home:** A busy professional receives a reminder that vegetables will expire soon and gets recipe ideas to use them that night.  

These day-to-day scenarios show how Fridge Finder becomes a practical part of users’ routines, helping them make decisions on what groceries to purchase, and what meals to plan for, to help save money and reduce food waste.

### Design Principles
Fridge Finder follows three core design principles:  

- **Simplicity:** Every interaction should be quick and intuitive — adding or checking an item takes only seconds.  
- **Usefulness:** Each feature must serve a clear purpose, from reminders to recipe suggestions, improving users’ daily efficiency.  
- **Accessibility:** The app should be easy to use for people with different lifestyles, technical skills, and schedules.
