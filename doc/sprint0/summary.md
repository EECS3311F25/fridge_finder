## Project Summary: Fridge Finder

Fridge Finder is a mobile app designed to help people stay on top of the food they have at home. By logging groceries with their expiry dates, users can easily see what’s fresh and what’s about to go bad. The app sends timely reminders, suggests recipes based on available ingredients, and helps avoid duplicate purchases at the store. Overall, it aims to make grocery management simpler, save users money, and reduce food waste.  

**Users →** Students who want to avoid expired food, families managing larger inventories, and anyone looking to save money.  

**Cases →** Adding food with expiry dates, checking an updated inventory, receiving reminders before items expire, getting recipe suggestions based on what’s at home, and avoiding duplicate purchases at the store.  

**Principles →** Fridge Finder is built around three key principles: 
- *Simplicity:* The app must be quick and intuitive to use — adding food should take only a few seconds.  
- *Usefulness:* Every feature should provide clear value, helping users make better decisions about food and groceries.  
- *Accessibility:* The design should work for all types of users, whether they’re students, busy parents, or professionals managing tight schedules.
