01/12/2025 - Sprint 3 Standup 1

1. **What did you work on since the last standup?:** Once again I'm submitting this standup late, but on the 29th I updated `doc/models.md` to reflect changes in the models made in the last few sprints.
2. **What do you commit to next?:** Next up is the documentation for the controllers, then for the views.
3. **When do you think you'll be done?:** Hopefully by end of day today.
4. **Do you have any blockers?:** I'm swamped with schoolwork and experiencing some personal issues outside of school.
