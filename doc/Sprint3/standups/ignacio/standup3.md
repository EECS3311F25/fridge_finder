28/11/2025 – Sprint 3 Standup 3
What did you work on since the last standup?
I worked on making all the views properly, like making the recipe view and the recipe page view. Also, I made the register and login work properly. Given that one of our teammates has droped the course I had to do a lot of work by myself.
What do you commit to next?
I will try to make the login properly work once I can get access to the backend
When do you think you’ll be done?
By monday.
Do you have any blockers?
Yes. A teammate has droped the course and I have to do a lot of work by myself.
