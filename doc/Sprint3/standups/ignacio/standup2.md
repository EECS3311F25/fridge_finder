28/11/2025 – Sprint 3 Standup 2
What did you work on since the last standup?
I implemented the `FilterItemController` to handle filtering and sorting of items (by name, frozen status, expiry date) and the `RecipeController` to manage recipe data retrieval and searching.
What do you commit to next?
I will focus on integrating these new controllers into the `HomeView` and `RecipePageView` to enable the actual filtering and recipe search functionality in the UI.
When do you think you’ll be done?
By the end of the week.
Do you have any blockers?
None.
