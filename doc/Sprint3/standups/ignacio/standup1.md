24/11/2025 – Sprint 3 Standup 1
What did you work on since the last standup?
I successfully separated the LoginController and RegisterController to decouple authentication and registration logic. I moved the user creation functionality into its own dedicated controller, cleaning up the codebase and improving maintainability.
What do you commit to next?
I will focus on polishing the controllers by implementing input validation, error handling, and security measures like password hashing to ensure robust user management.
When do you think you’ll be done?
By the end of the week.
Do you have any blockers?
None.
