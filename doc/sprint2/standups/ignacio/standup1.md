06/11/2025 - Sprint 2 Standup 1
1. What did you work on since the last standup? 
    I removed unused controllers, added some needed controllers, moved most of the methods to the controllers from the views and streamline item search functionality.                                           
2.  What do you commit to next? 
    Continue working on making controllers as easy and simple as posible to make work for my partners more comfortable.
3. When do you think you'll be done?    
    I think that by the end of this weekend I should have all controller classes working with no problem
4. Do you have any blockers? 
    I need the people from the front-end to implement and debug my methods so if I need to make any changes I can make them ASAP.
