17/11/2025 – Sprint 2 Standup 3
What did you work on since the last standup?
I finished resolving the database schema issues, fixed the item insertion workflow, and aligned the AddItemController and HomeController so the fridge updates properly after adding items. I also validated table creation and ensured the data model now fully matches the UI/UX logic.
What do you commit to next?
I will focus on finalizing the HomeView update flow, making sure item addition, deletion, and filtering all react correctly in real time. I’ll also continue cleaning up controller responsibilities to keep the architecture consistent.
When do you think you’ll be done?
By tonight.
Do you have any blockers?
Now the back-end still mostly has some issues need to be fixed.
