16/11/2025 – Sprint 2 Standup 2
What did you work on since the last standup?
I implemented the new RecipePageController, refined the search logic, and continued organizing controller files to keep responsibilities clean and separated.
What do you commit to next?
I’ll keep simplifying controller logic and ensure each controller fully supports the features the front-end team needs.
When do you think you’ll be done?
Before tomorrow.
Do you have any blockers?
I still depend on front-end integration to confirm the controllers behave correctly and adjust anything that doesn’t match their implementation.
