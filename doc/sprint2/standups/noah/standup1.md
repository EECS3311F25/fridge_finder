10/11/2025 - Sprint 2 Standup 1

1. **What did you work on since the last standup?:** This standup is a bit late, but a few days ago I refactored the models to contain methods more appropriate for object instantiation, depending on whether or not a DB insertion is necessary.
2. **What do you commit to next?:** Next, I commit to creating the CRC cards for the new classes necessary for this sprint.
3. **When do you think you'll be done?:** I'm busy with my second wave of midterms, work, and the fact that I'm very sick, but I think I can finish the CRC cards either tonight or tomorrow.
4. **Do you have any blockers?:** No technical blockers, just the aforementioned things keeping me busy.
