[16/11/2025] - Sprint #2 Standup #4
**1. What did you work on since the last standup?**
I completed the recipes pages. The recipe_page_view.dart shows a column of recipes, each with an icon, title, and description, and when you click the container it leads the user to the recipe page. For this sprint, this will remain static, but we will further implement this in the next. I also worked with my other group mates on merging my contributions that I made in my branch with the rest of the project so we can the front end I created up and working for the demo video.

**2. What do you commit to next?**
We will work on polishing the project for the demo video, so everything is working.

**3. When do you think you'll be done?**
We will finish tomorrow.

**4. Do you have any blockers?**
There are no blockers.
