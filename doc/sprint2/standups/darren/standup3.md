[15/11/2025] - Sprint #2 Standup #3
**1. What did you work on since the last standup?**
I made additions to home_view.dart -- in the header there is now a circular white button with an A that leads to the account/login page. I also added a button on the bottom left of the home view that is a green circle with an R, this leads the user to the recipes page which matches my original design for the user interface in sprint0. I also completed the text fields and input boxes in the account page

**2. What do you commit to next?**
I need to flesh out the recipes pages, aswell as work my groupmates to implement the login feature, aswell as connecting the rest of the views to the controllers

**3. When do you think you'll be done?**
I will continue to work on this tomorrow

**4. Do you have any blockers?**
I am waiting on others in the group to help connect the views to the controller
