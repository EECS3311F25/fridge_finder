[13/11/2025] - Sprint #2 Standup #2
**1. What did you work on since the last standup?**
I've worked on improving the existing views. I rewrote a lot of the code so the views are consistent across all screens, this includes updating the headers to sick to a consistent format, changing the fonts so they are consistent sizes, and several other minor changes to everything else in the views aswell.

**2. What do you commit to next?**
I want to create the new views that are specified in the system design. This includes login_view.dart recipe_page_view.dart and recipe_view.dart -- Additionally, I will update home_view.dart to allow for navigation to all of these new screens.

**3. When do you think you'll be done?**
I will continue to work on it tomorrow and on the weekend

**4. Do you have any blockers?**
No I dont have any blockers
