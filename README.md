===============

Project in progess


Motivation
---------------
As full-time computer science students who know their priority is to study, sometimes keeping up with daily life and academic work can be a little overwhelming. The fact that school tasks take up so much space in our minds often causes us to neglect our homes, which can lead to skipping meals and forgetting to eat a healthy diet. That’s why Fridge Finder was created — to help us stay focused on studying without completely neglecting something as basic as eating well.
